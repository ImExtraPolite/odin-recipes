    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>This Pan-Seared Steak has a garlic rosemary-infused butter that makes it taste steakhouse quality. You’ll be impressed at how easy it is to make the perfect steak – seared and caramelized on the outside, and so juicy inside.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>steak (of your choice)</li>
      <li>salt</li>
      <li>pepper</li>
      <li>butter</li>
      <li>rosmary</li>
      <li>thyme</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
      <li><p>Preheat a sous vide cooker to desired final temperature. (See note for temperature and timing charts, or find the same charts here.) Season steaks generously with salt and pepper. Place in sous vide bags along with herbs, garlic, and shallots (if using) and distribute evenly. Seal bags and place in water bath for desired time according to charts.</p></li>
      <li><p>To Finish in a Pan: Turn on your vents and open your windows. Remove steak from water bath and bag and carefully pat dry with paper towels. Add vegetable, canola, or rice bran oil to a heavy cast iron or stainless steel skillet, then place over the hottest burner you have and preheat skillet until it starts to smoke.</p></li>
      <li><p>Gently lay steak in skillet, using your fingers or a set of tongs. If desired, add a tablespoon of butter; for a cleaner-tasting sear, omit the butter at this stage.</p></li>
      <li><p>After 15 to 30 seconds, flip steak so that the second side comes into contact with the pan. Repeat, flipping steak every 15 to 30 seconds, until it has developed a nice brown sear, about 1 1/2 minutes total. If you did not add butter earlier, add butter to skillet about 30 seconds before steak is done for added richness. Serve steak immediately.</p></li>
      <li><p>Transfer cooked steak to a cutting board or serving platter and serve immediately.</p></li>
    </ol>
